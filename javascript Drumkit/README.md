# Javascript Drumkit Project

This exercise is taken from [Wesbos'](https://github.com/wesbos) [Javascript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) exercise repo. It's aim is to learn the basics of DOM manipulation by creating a drumkit.

The exercise came with a prebuilt css and skeleton html. My job was to create the script. I also changed the design of the page a little bit.

## How to use?

You can click the drums keys, or use your keyboard to hit the corresponding keys.
